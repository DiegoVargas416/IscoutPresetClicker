1. Open chrome://extensions/ in your chrome browser bar
2. Enable the "Developer mode" slider (usually top right in the browser pane).
3. Drag and drop the IscoutPresetclicker.crx into the browser pane and install.

Add presets you have defined in IScout and reference them as presets in the clicker.
Add an interval time (in seconds) and select the days you want this preset to be loaded.
Set your server reset time at the bottom relative to your local time where your browser runs.

Enjoy.
